00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.400
Is there anyone here?

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.320
Help!

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.560
Anyone’s here?

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.720
I need help.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:26.800
Can anybody hear me?

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.920
Can anybody hear me?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.000
Help me please!

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.440
You...

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.360
I’m dreaming like this again?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.920
Are you up? Nu-lin.

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.159
Yes, I already woke up.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.520
Today is the first day of your internship.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.600
Fighting

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.560
You should hurry and go shower.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.360
Thanks, P’Sun.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.280
The total turnover of the Soul High Jewelry

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.800
doesn’t look really good for the past few quarters.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.800
We just started doing online business

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.880
so in the last quarter we spent a lot of money to invest there.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:30.720
No matter how much investment we put in

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.560
it won’t do much if our designs are still outdated.

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:33.159
Erm…

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.800
Mr. Somchai, Have a look at our new campaign please.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.440
I think it’s a bit too late.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.000
Or maybe our presenter may be able to attract

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.080
enough buyers to make our brand become the attention of the market.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.080
Are you implying

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.320
that there are errors

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.680
in our policy?

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.680
And also

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.280
Madame Wang is the one who handpicked the presenter herself.

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.200
But wasn't it because the vision

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.400
that we’ve been sworn by for the last 30 years

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.040
made us successful?

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.960
It’s just

00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.520
at the moment….

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.640
Huhh

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.480
I’m sitting right here

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.520
just be honest about it.

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:16.200
What seems to be  the problem

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.120
just tell me directly.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:20.720
I’m going to be honest then

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:22.720
I think our vision

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.120
is very old fashioned.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.720
I think

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.280
that it’s time that we should consider rebranding.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.880
Soul High Jewelry really needs a change.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.920
Mr. Suriyen

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.000
someone’s calling you.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.080
Yes, mommy

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.039
Alright

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:41.799
Chan

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:43.919
Can you please get the car ready?

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.240
We will be heading back to Bangkok.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:47.960
Yes, sir.

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.080
Please get in.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:19.200
Thank you so much.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.880
Please drive safe.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.280
I’ve already arrived at the office.

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.800
I hope you have a good day.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.440
No matter what happened,

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.360
you can do it

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.280
Lin.

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:40.760
Pim and Yo still haven’t arrived yet.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.240
Hello, Lin.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.720
Hello, Pim where are you now?

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.480
Still haven't got here?

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.520
No, I just got here

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.440
I’m going up there soon.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:55.480
Wait

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.160
and hold the door for me please!

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.960
Thank you.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.480
Pim, wait for me too.

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.400
Yo!

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.320
Pim, just wait for me a bit.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760
The elevator is going up now.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.640
Hurry!

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:09.840
Faster!

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.560
Come on!

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.400
Yo!

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.040
Hurry!

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.200
Please wait for my friend just a little moment.

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.160
Hey, two of you

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.000
want to come in or not?

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.040
We’re coming in.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.680
We are getting late now.

00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.880
I’m sorry. Sorry.

00:11:59.280 --> 00:11:59.680
Hey!

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:00.560
Wait!

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:02.040
I got here first.

00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:02.960
Sorry about that,

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:03.760
but I’m also in a hurry.

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:06.280
Let’s go and close the doors too.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.400
Yo,

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.480
then I’m going up first. You need to hurry now!

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.120
Pim!

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.640
Where is Yo?

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.840
I think he is on his way up here.

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:21.000
What?

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:22.400
Why isn’t he here yet?

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.680
Huhh

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:25.840
Yo!

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:26.800
Finally, you’re here.

00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:27.480
Hurry!

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.640
เห้อ

00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.520
I don’t know who that guy is

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.760
but he stole my spot on the elavator.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.480
Yeah.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.200
Hey!

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:42.960
Nerdy,

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.320
why did you steal my spot?

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.600
I actually got there before you

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600
and you also bumped into me as well.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.840
No! I got to the elevator first

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.120
and you are the one who bumped into me.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.320
No, you bumped into me

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.640
I got to the elevato way ahead of you.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.360
I was there first!

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.240
You bumped me!

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.360
No, you bumped me!

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.480
No, it’s you!

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.240
Quiet!

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:04.720
You guys

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:06.920
are already

00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.240
10 minutes late

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.160
on your first day!

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.360
Here’ a thing,

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.920
the elevator was full

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.560
and

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.640
the was ‘something’

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.800
that stole my spot.

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.040
That is not an excuse

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760
to be late.

00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:28.840
Late is late. Doesn’t really matter.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.040
Go!

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.600
And get back in the line with your friends.

00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:35.200
Hey!

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:37.000
You guys know

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:39.120
that being 10 minutes late

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.720
might be nothing

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.640
for you guys.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:43.720
But in the 10 minutes

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.640
can be super beneficial

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.360
for us here at work.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.080
Hm?

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.800
If even just one of you were late

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:55.920
that meant that all of you were late as well.

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.040
As it is said that

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.480
one rotten apple

00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.440
Ahem

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.600
spoils the whole barrel.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:08.520
Since here

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.480
we work as a team.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.320
If you can’t even be on time,

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.240
how can you be responsible for anything?

00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:16.640
Isn’t that right?

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.200
Answer me. Isn't that right!

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.560
That’s right!

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:23.680
Hands on your friends' necks.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.000
What!

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.560
I thought that we escaped

00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:28.960
the SOTUS system.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:30.840
Come on,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.960
didn’t you say before that

00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.200
“where there's a will, there's a way”.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.560
What are you two whispering about!

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:37.560
Repeat my command!

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.840
Sqaut 10 times!

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:42.520
Squat 10 times!

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:43.120
Start!

00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.120
Just what are you all doing now?

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:50.120
Erm..

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:52.080
Er..

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.160
P’Kaew, good morning.

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.080
Well,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.360
I’m about to

00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.200
punish these interns

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.600
for being late.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:02.400
I've been waiting for my interns for quite a while now.

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:04.000
Are all of these

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.560
will be working in the design department right?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.600
Er..

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.960
They will be divided into 3 teams.

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:10.280
There are team A, B, and C.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.480
พี่ พี่แก้วครับ

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.400
Can I see

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.280
each team?

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.240
Er..

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.000
Yes,

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:16.400
Team C!

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.200
Where is team C?

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.440
Okay,

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.920
team C you need to

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:21.640
follow Jen here.

00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:22.720
You can go now.

00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.320
Go. Go.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.760
And what’s next?

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:27.720
Where’s Team B?

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.960
You three need

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:29.520
to

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:31.680
follow Mrs. Bow this way

00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:32.960
please.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:34.600
P’ Kaew,

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.840
this is team A right?

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:37.840
Yes.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.640
Team A,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:40.480
then

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.600
follows me

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.640
to the design department now.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:45.360
Work hard everybody!

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.720
You’re in Team A?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:51.520
Yes, just go first.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.720
The building is quite far away.

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.760
Fighting!

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.760
Dis, you need to come too!

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.560
This is our design department building kiddos.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.360
It is a building that is separated from the executive building.

00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.080
Our company’s president or Madame Wang

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.880
really prioritizes our department.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:23.680
That’s why she wanted

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.320
us to be surrounded by nature as much as she could.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:28.080
That is so beautiful.

00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.480
Let’s go inside.

00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:30.920
Stunning!

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.720
Sick!

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.520
During luch break

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.960
if anyone wants to eat

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.440
there’s a room for it as well.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.720
That room is located on the first floor where you were,

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.360
there will be beverage

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.440
and food provided for free

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.480
which is one of our policies as well.

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.640
Wow!

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:54.880
This is my

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.320
dream work place.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.040
I’m going to eat everything

00:16:58.400 --> 00:16:59.640
and even bring some home too.

00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:00.720
Hurry and get inside.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.960
Hurry! Hurry!

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.680
It’s really hot out here.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.560
Here is our designing room.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.960
We’ve been walking together for a while but I haven’t introduced myself yet.

00:17:18.359 --> 00:17:19.480
My name is Kaewmanee.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:21.280
I am the head of the design department here.

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.839
Hello.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:25.079
Hello too.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:26.200
My name is Salin.

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.280
I’m Pim.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.520
My name is Yotha.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:29.480
And I’m Sam.

00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.120
Our department we work like a family,

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:34.880
so if you need my help

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:36.520
like what just happened

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.840
you  can tell me right away.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.000
And also

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.320
the rules of the interns who work here

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.320
aren’t really fussy.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.400
As for the uniform,

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.920
if it is an important

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:49.120
or the day that we might have a meeting.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.920
You must wear something formal

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:52.640
like student uniforms.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.200
If it is a chill day

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.880
at work

00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.480
you can dress appropriately.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.080
It just needs to be a pair of  long pants and shoes that cover your heels.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:05.600
Do not forget the name tag.

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:07.720
It is really important in our company.

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.920
We must wear it all the time

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.240
when we are working here.

00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:13.080
Thank you.

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.080
Thank you.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.800
Thank you.

00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.120
Thank you.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.440
Prim,

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.840
you got here just in time.

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.200
Why don’t you come and introduce yourself to our new interns.

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.560
She’s our deputy head.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.680
Her name is Primrada.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.320
Hello

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.400
Please take care of us.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.960
Have you received the work that I sent to you?

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.880
Yes, I already got it.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.880
Did you already print it out?

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.080
Yes, I did.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:09.040
We need to have another meeting about this.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.320
Why is P’Prim so arrogant?

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.320
Yo!

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:16.120
She’s just cool

00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:17.640
not arrogant.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.560
Ah

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:20.960
So this is the one?

00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.280
Your idol who won

00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:24.880
the designing competition.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:26.360
when she was in university.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.800
You were really into her right?

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:30.440
I’m going to pinch you just now!

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.040
Everybody,

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600
please take care of these interns.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.400
I have a meeting with Prim

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:39.160
so I need to go now.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.440
See you around!

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.240
This way please.

00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:43.440
Oh

00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:44.720
I forgot to tell you one thing.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.520
The document room

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.440
at the end of the hallway.

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.520
It stores really important documents.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.160
Please, try not to go in there

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.560
if not necessary.

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.000
Yes!

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.720
Let’s go.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:03.440
Hey!

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.600
Insane?

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.400
Alright!

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.480
Are you guys ready to help me with all the work?

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:27.280
So!

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.960
Ready?

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.320
Yes!

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.240
Huh

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.480
Huh

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.640
Seriously!

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.560
Are we working in a designing company

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:45.000
Or in a hotel?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.040
Lin!

00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:47.680
It is going to spill.

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680
Oh my god!

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040
Sun, can you open the door?

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.960
Come in. Come in.

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.120
Food is here.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:54.640
Right here.

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.760
Yo, hurry up!

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:56.960
Ugh!

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.560
Why do we have to carry these things in the middle of the night!

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.160
What else can we do?

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.200
This is what we got asked to do. Hurry, Yo!

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.160
Wait.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.120
Faster!

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:05.960
Pff

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.320
If I own the company.

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.640
I’m going to fire all of you.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.440
Don’t complain too much.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.240
Ouch!

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.360
Yo

00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:16.040
What!

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.440
Darn it!

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.280
Quick! Quick! Quick!

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:19.680
Yo, you have to be careful.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.320
I know.

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:22.720
For real!

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.480
Not yet, it is not clean yet.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.360
It is a big cleaning day.

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:29.640
I should take a picture and report to the boss.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.080
That’s why it is called a big cleaning day.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.360
Yes!

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.480
Yo,

00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.000
did we really spend a hundred grand to work here?

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.160
to work here?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200
I thought we are going to learn

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.160
about jewelry.

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.040
Turnt out we are currently cleaning the mirrors.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:51.760
Argh,

00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:53.880
what’s wrong with you, Yo ?

00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:56.480
I’m here as an intern in designing

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:57.480
not a a servnant.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.760
They make me do so much.

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:00.680
Your’re right!

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.760
Lower your voice. They might hear you.

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:04.920
It’s hard enough as it is

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.600
or you want more chores from them.

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.760
I’m so sick of it, Lin.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200
Sick of what?

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.600
You didn't get to wipe the mirror

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:15.440
and also didn’t carry boxes like us.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.280
Can’t I be sick of those chores with you?

00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.200
Fine.

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.760
Ops!

00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.440
Soul High Jewelry,

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:23.520
Madame Wang who’s leading in Jewelry.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.600
Why did she offer jobs for these people?

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.800
I don't get it.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:28.840
I really wanna know,

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:31.760
if she doesn’t have any heir to run a company.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.160
Maybe her son is also an incompetent.

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:41.440
What’s your problem?

00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.200
No!

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.560
Got something in your throat!

00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:54.640
Don’t forget to have a meal.

00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:57.200
Hey,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.520
What are you doing?

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:01.120
What?

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.320
Don’t forget to have a meal,

00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:09.000
Lin.

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.680
Hahaha

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.800
Stop it!

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.800
It’s because of two of you

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:17.840
I have to talk with him.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.800
If this is a movie,

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.440
there should be a flashback scene.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:25.840
One

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.680
Two

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.400
Three

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:30.320
Hi, friends.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.320
Meet my new boyfriend.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.320
Okay?

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.920
Finally,

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.320
we three get to intern in the same company.

00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.160
What are we waiting for then?

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:41.920
Cheer!

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:46.000
Whoa!

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:46.800
Ugh!

00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.000
Yo againn.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.120
Me again?

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.560
I can’t take it any more.

00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.560
Truth

00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.840
or Dare

00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:57.480
Dare

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.280
I want my friend to have a relationship.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.680
Can you try

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.520
using a dating app

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:03.600
and

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.280
talk with someone?

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.440
No!

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.720
I already told you that I don’t want to do that.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:10.520
โอ๊ย

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:15.520
Lin,

00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:16.360
Huh?

00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:17.200
Let me take your pictures.

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.400
Smile more.

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:19.800
Last one.

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:23.200
You’re cheating.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.640
Did you really use his phone to download a dating app?

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.160
Well, you did not specify who.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.240
Isn’t ture?

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680
Yo’re so smart.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:32.600
This is why

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.480
we are friends.

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.400
Pim,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.040
is he hand some?

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.520
Very much so!

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720
Swipe right!

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.840
Yeah!

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:11.520
Hello,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.320
my name is Sun.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:17.720
Who’s this?

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:27.200
Can you get the app and talk to someone?

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.320
Lin, let me take your pictures.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.440
Last one!

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.440
Swipe right!

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.200
Yo!!!

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:36.960
Yay!

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:38.840
Is it that funny?

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:41.000
You two keep mocking me.

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.400
Come on,

00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.520
at least what I did

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.240
got you someone to talk to.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:47.720
Your’re right.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.640
Where else can you find good friends like us?

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.320
True!

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:51.560
I mean

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.680
you’ve been talking with him for a while.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:55.600
Have you met him in person yet?

00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.320
Oh my god!

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:02.800
Why?

00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.520
It’s been weeks

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.720
and you haven’t even got to meet him.

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.040
Uhm,

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:10.800
it’s that bad?

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.320
Honestly,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.800
I’m afraid

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:19.200
so I think

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:20.800
just only talk like this

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:21.720
is fine.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.320
Or,

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.880
are you scared of losing you v…

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:34.560
Pim!

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:36.240
Hey,

00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.400
what are you thinking about?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.160
You’re crazy!

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.920
That’s right.

00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.440
I think

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.600
if you get a chance you should

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.840
go out with him.

00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:45.880
Do you have any

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.880
picture of him for me to see?

00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:48.880
Hey!

00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:52.920
Go easy!

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.080
We are just getting to know each other.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.320
Why would you wanna know?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:57.560
Are you two close?

00:26:59.160 --> 00:26:59.760
Yo..

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.520
Sam is also our friend.

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.360
Just be nice to each other.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.600
เออ

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:07.880
From the pictue,

00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:09.200
I think

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.440
he’s around 30 years old.

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:20.680
In that picture,

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.480
he also looks

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.080
like he’s in good shape

00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.920
and knows how to dress.

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480
A little bit like a bad boy maybe,

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.600
wise, and

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:46.440
gentle at the same time.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.680
Those are kinda what he looks like.

00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.280
I can see the picture in my head.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:00.680
Have a look, Sam.

00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:02.480
His picture.

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:13.880
Why?

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.360
Is he not okay?

00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:20.800
Er..

00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.240
No, Lin.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.640
He looks good,

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.480
but I agree with you

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.080
that you should talk a little longer before

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.520
meeting him.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:32.480
People these days are not that good.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.240
Just trust me.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:34.320
Okay.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:36.320
Are you okay?

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.160
Weren’t you just telling him to meet the guy?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.720
Just suddenly changed your mind.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.360
Do you not tell us anything?

00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.560
Why are you so concerned about me?

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:44.960
Have a look yourself.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.480
See?

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:46.560
Let me see.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.040
How is he?

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:49.720
Got a pass?

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.560
He looks good

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.800
but I look better.

00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:58.080
We should just hurry and eat

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.360
because we have to get back to work soon.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:00.800
Argh!

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.480
Joykiller!

00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.640
Why would you have to bring that up?

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:04.520
Calm down!

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.440
Are we working on designing or

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.880
carrying boxes?

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:08.200
So that I can prepare myself.

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.640
In the pattern,

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:15.320
we’re trying to cooperate the contemporary Thai elements

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.320
so, we think of Thai silk.

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.080
Thai silk is a local wisdom.

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:20.920
I think it is

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.640
what we should conserve

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.520
by cooperating Thai silk patterns into this collection of jewelry.

00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:27.440
Pim,

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.080
do you think

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:31.760
this collection

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.840
looks the same as the last one.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.440
Exactly,

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:38.640
except

00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:41.920
P’Prim isn’t the one who came up with this repetitive idea.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.920
Excuse me,

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.160
what are you guys talking about?

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.760
We are in a meeting room.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.400
Have some manners?

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.680
It’s not that

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.440
we weren’t just chatting

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:07.680
but we

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:11.040
were discussing about the designs.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.520
Why don’t you two just stand up and

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.920
discuss it with all of us then.

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.240
Stand up!

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:22.920
Erm..

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.720
Prim, I think you shouldn’t be upset at them.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.120
I don’t have any problem

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.840
I just want to teach them to

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.320
be opinionated.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:33.840
You know

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.240
by sharing your opinion

00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.880
is a key part in developing a product.

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.640
If you don’t have the guts to do that,

00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.880
how can you present your own designs?

00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.000
What do you say?

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:50.880
Lin!

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.440
I think

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.280
even if we still want to keep our brand identity

00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:58.920
but

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:00.680
this collection

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.360
looks too similar to the one

00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:07.240
that came out in the same season last year.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:12.280
Eh!

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.280
What are you talking about?

00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.680
You are just an intern.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.080
How can you criticize these pieces?

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:20.000
Erm,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.120
didn’t you ask for my opinion?

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:23.840
So I just said

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.640
what I saw.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160
Do you know

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.600
how much profit that collection

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.720
made for our company?

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.320
Are newly grads like you guys can take a risk

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.920
if we came out with ne designs

00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.040
and we can’t keep the loyalty of our customers?

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.240
If those customers don’t come back

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:42.440
what would you do?

00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.760
Can you be responsible for that?

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.480
Interrns.

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.160
One month later

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.440
What am I doing?

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.920
Aren’t you tired my boy?

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.160
I’m tired to the point that I’m used to it.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.200
The situation isn’t getting better at all

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.680
at you office?

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.320
No, not at all.

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.000
It’s been a month and

00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:01.320
I haven’t got a chance to design something.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:05.040
I’m thinking that I made the wrong decision in coming to work here.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.280
You’ll be fine.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.080
You will get through this.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.720
It’s been weeks

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.200
and you haven’t met him in real life.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:21.160
I’m afraid to do that.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.880
P’Sun, do you think we will ever have a chance to meet each other just once?

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:35.160
Oh wow!

00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.760
I just got back

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.960
and my deary little brother

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.680
just show up right away.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:48.320
Of course, I have to come.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.160
It’s been a while I really miss you.

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.760
So how is it?

00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.400
Is the company still the same as you told me?

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.000
Not a thing has changed.

00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.800
Our employees still stuck with the old patterns.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.880
Nothing’s new.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.000
Maybe they are afraid of making mistakes.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.600
So this is the problem that

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.520
make our sales don’t go higher.

00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.159
It’s not just that

00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.960
I think there’s something else as well.

00:34:17.719 --> 00:34:18.800
Something else?

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.760
If I find anything more

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.520
I will tell you right away.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:26.440
And now,

00:34:27.239 --> 00:34:28.360
it’s been a month exactly.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.560
Your job is over right?

00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.800
About the deal that we made,

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.560
I’ll get that gone for you.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:36.639
Hia,

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:39.679
can I stay for one or two more months?

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.120
I’ll tell you later.

00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.159
What makes you wanna stay longer?

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:50.400
I remembered when I asked you to work there

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.600
you didn't want to do that.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:53.760
What is it?

00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.199
There’s nothing.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:57.600
Just leave me alone.

00:34:58.440 --> 00:34:59.600
Are you sure about that?

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.880
If mom finds out that you’re back and didn't tell her,

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.440
you’ll be in trouble.

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:07.240
Alright!

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.560
I got it.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.640
How about you?

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.000
Since you are already back here,

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.840
will you go and meet that person?

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:16.240
I think

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.240
that I’m going to see him

00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:20.720
but I got scare that

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.680
he’s going to be like everyone that I've ever been with.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600
No, I don’t think so

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:31.640
I’ve got a hunch that

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:34.400
this one will be better than anyone.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.040
What a weird thing to say!

00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.640
Do you know something?

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.480
No,

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:42.840
nope.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.520
Not at all.

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.440
No, for real!

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.040
You’re laughing!

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.280
Hia!

00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:48.960
What do you know?

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.680
I’m just gonna go unload tonight.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.960
If I think of something I will tell you right away.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:55.120
Heyy!

00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:55.960
Just tell me now/Let me go

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:56.880
Hia,

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:58.280
I’m leaving.

00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.480
I want to eat Somtam.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:19.040
I want to eat Somtam.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:21.160
You already ate three dishes. Is it not enough?

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:22.120
How hungry are you?

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:22.600
Well,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.960
it was super delicious.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.400
Ops!

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:36.800
We’re sorry.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:44.240
What are they doing?

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.360
Yeah!

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.360
The atmosphere is

00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:47.840
very serious.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.440
P’Prim,

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:03.920
What are you all doing?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.360
Is there anything for us to help?

00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.040
Hahaha!

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.280
You just embarrassed yourself.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:27.160
Watch and learn.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.640
Hello! P’Juladis.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.840
Why do you have to sneak up on me?

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:39.480
Er..

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:40.600
Phew!

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.360
what are you doing?

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.200
Of course, we’re designing.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:46.120
Our whole department have to

00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.000
find the best idea

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.320
and compete with other design departments.

00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:52.480
It counts as an annual evaluation

00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:55.560
and also an opportunity to shine.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.960
Can we interns compete too?

00:37:58.760 --> 00:37:59.600
Hahaha

00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.120
What?

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.560
What did you just say?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:04.600
Well,

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:06.800
can we join the competition?

00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.560
Ahh

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.440
If all of you

00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:13.880
You

00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:14.880
You

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.640
and you

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.480
are confident

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:21.880
that you are better than us

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.040
then try.

00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:25.160
Please do your best.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:33.960
This is it.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:36.120
Our opportunity are

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:37.720
finally here.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:39.200
Fighting!

00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.920
Fighting!

00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.240
Good morning, everyone.

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.600
I hope that you are all doing well.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:52.920
After our last meeting

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.880
had me thought

00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.440
about back

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.120
when our Soul High Jewelry

00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:59.640
were glorious.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:02.920
But today

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.880
it’s not the same anymore.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.480
We really need to change.

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.280
I would like to thank everyone

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:12.760
for helping

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.160
our company

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:16.600
moving forward.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.640
I also would like everyone

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.240
to cooperate

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:20.840
with

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.880
our new president.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.480
Which is

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:31.880
Mr. Suriyen Thanahirankan.

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.760
My own son.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.240
What?

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.800
Has Mr.Sun returned from abroad?

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.240
Gossip Time

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:48.720
What do you think is

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.200
the reason why Madame Wang stepped down from her company?

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.160
I don’t know.

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.040
Maybe she’s just tired.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.000
I’m not sure too

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.680
but it might be good.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.000
I heard that her son would take over this company.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.520
What do you think a son of that auntie

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.720
would be like?

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:06.840
I think

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.960
her son

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.680
may be full of egos just like her.

00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:12.360
He’s not.

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:18.560
He may not be

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:19.960
egotistic.

00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:22.840
Why?

00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.440
Do you know her son?

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:26.600
No,

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.080
I just heard from

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:29.680
someone in our team said that

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.360
her son graduated

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.080
from abroad and

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.240
worked there.

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.000
Wow!

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.720
What a nice profile!

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:39.840
Calm down!

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:41.760
You already got a husband.

00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:42.920
Yo!

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.280
Why would you say that?

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.920
People might misunderstand me.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:47.080
Be quiet!

00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:48.680
Don’t you konw?

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.760
No wedding means no boyfriend.

00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.000
Lin, are you free this Saturday at 7 P.M.?

00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.560
Lin,

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:56.960
are you alright?

00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.640
Look

00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:03.680
What?!

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.640
He asked you to a hotel.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:10.120
What have you two been talking about? Hotel on a first date.

00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:12.880
He might just take me to have dinner.

00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.760
Don’t pessimistic.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.120
No one wants your opinion.

00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:23.480
I’m just talking to myself

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:25.600
not to you.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:32.840
Lin,

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.040
what are you going to do?

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.480
Will you go?

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:40.080
I

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.920
don’t know.

00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:44.800
Actually,

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.720
this Saturday

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.640
don’t we have to rush our jewelry design?

00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:50.880
You’re right!

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:53.400
Don’t worry!

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.320
For a date

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.720
we will take care of the work for you.

00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.320
We will finish it for you.

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:01.840
We? What is we?

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:03.000
You do that alone.

00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.240
If we work

00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:06.760
we have to work together.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.200
It’s due this saturday.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.200
Yo, don’t you see? Lin wants to go and

00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:12.840
opportunities like this don't come very often.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.760
How’s going?

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.120
I think

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.760
I’m nearly done.

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:28.800
What do you think

00:42:30.920 --> 00:42:31.920
about right here?

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.400
I think it looks good

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.000
but

00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.600
you could make it a bit thinner.

00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:39.560
Shit!

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:41.000
It’s 7 P.M.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.640
Shit!

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.400
7 P.M.

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.200
I’ll take care of your outfits.

00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.080
Make me look good!

00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:48.400
Alright!

00:42:48.800 --> 00:42:49.320
Yo

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.320
Okay! Okay! Wait! Wait!

00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:51.880
Almost done.

00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.320
Hurry!

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:57.520
Turn it off for me.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.480
Okay

00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:12.840
Wow!

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.560
You look good.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.360
Very stunning!

00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:17.640
Really?

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.040
Yes.

00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:20.880
Wow,

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.520
look at how shine and sparkling he is

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.320
you can be seen from outer space.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:28.960
Am I really looking good?

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:30.440
100 out of 100

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.360
I’ll give you a million.

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.160
Don’t you think

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.680
that it is a little much?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.280
More is less!

00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:40.800
Hey!

00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:42.400
who’s texting you?

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.200
Ready to see me?

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.360
Nu-Lin.

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:48.200
I’m ready.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.840
I’m counting to see you.

00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.320
Whatever your decision may be

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:11.160
we are here.

00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:16.400
Even though I really don’t want you to go.

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.960
Let the world see

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.160
how stunning you are.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:24.760
Thanks you!

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:32.480
Feel better?

00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.360
So much better.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.720
Excuse me,

00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.000
err

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.240
I’m a guest of Mr. Sun.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.080
He told me that he already made a table reservation.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.680
Just a moment please.

00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:06.320
Here you are.

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:08.280
He asked me to tell you that

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.520
you can wait in the room

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.360
which we prepared.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.520
A room?

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:15.800
Yes, sir.

00:46:21.920 --> 00:46:22.720
P’Sun

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:16.400
We finally met,

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.800
Nu-Lin

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240
P’Sun

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:01.480
Ready to meet each other,

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.080
Nu-Lin?

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:04.440
I’m ready.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:06.640
Nu-Lin, are you ready to meet up?

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.320
Lin,

00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:15.960
what are you thinking?

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.040
Hm,

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.920
we’ll get to see each other soon.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.240
Nu-Lin

00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.480
P’Sun

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.280
Have you been waiting for a long time,

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.760
Nu-Lin?

00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:07.520
Let me take you to your condo.

00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:10.800
Didn’t you tell me that you are just an ordinary office worker?

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.360
But,

00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.800
why do you have a motorbike that costs a million baht?

00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.280
We really did nothing

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.400
just held hands.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.360
Are you telling the truth?

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.800
The interns that you want to meet are here.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.960
Can I talk with Mr.Salin privately?

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.480
Is there anything that I can do for you sir?

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:29.200
Lin, please give me a chance.
